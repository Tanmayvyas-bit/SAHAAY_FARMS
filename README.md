SAHAAY FARMS is an intelligent farm management system that uses Machine Learning (ML) to assist farmers in making smart decisions.
The system integrates three core ML models designed to help farmers with:

🌱 Crop Recommendation – Suggests the best crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions.

🌾 Fertilizer Recommendation – Provides optimal fertilizer suggestions to maximize yield and maintain soil health.

🍂 Crop Disease Detection – Detects plant diseases from leaf images to help farmers take timely corrective actions.

🚀 Features

🧑‍🌾 Personalized Crop Recommendations based on NPK levels, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.

💧 Fertilizer Optimization for sustainable nutrient management.

📸 AI-Powered Disease Detection using image classification (CNN model).

🌤️ User-Friendly Dashboard to input parameters and view recommendations.

☁️ Scalable Architecture that can be integrated with IoT sensors and mobile applications.
